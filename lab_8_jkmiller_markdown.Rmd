### Load Packages

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
### Read in data and data source

salmon <- read_csv("salmon.csv")

# Loaded file with  obs of 2 variables

# Source: 
# Aquaculture Trade tables
# U.S. imports and exports of fish and shellfish that may be products of aquaculture.
# All years and all countries
# Created November 5, 2018
# Updates of this data can be found at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/aquaculture-data.aspx

```

```{r}
### 4. Exploratory scatterplot

scatter_salmon <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point()
scatter_salmon

# The plot looks like a linear relationship. The residuals will probably be normally distributed.

```

```{r}
### 5. Linear Regression in R
# Linear regression of total trend in the colume of fresh salmon imported to the U.S. from 1990 to 2017.

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)
salmon_model

# Imports(tons) = -14982940 + 7550(Year)

# On average the annual imports

```
